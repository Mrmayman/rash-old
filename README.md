# Update
This project is discontinued.

The new version (rewrite) is available at https://github.com/Mrmayman/rash/

# Rash (old version)
A basic Scratch interpreter written in rust. This is the old legacy version.

# Setup and usage
Until this is stable for proper use, you have to compile it from source.

Just git clone this or download it as zip. Make sure you have rust installed, and navigate to the directory in terminal. Then do `cargo run -- path/to/your/file.sb3`

There are a few test sb3 files in the tests directory. For more information, go to tests/README.md

# Credits
- Massive thanks to the creator of [svg2colored-png](https://github.com/MCorange99/svg2colored-png)! I couldn't figure out how to load SVG costumes but thanks to this, I can convert them to PNG.
- Further thanks to the authors of all the libraries I used.
- Also huge credit to the people in the Griffpatch Discord server for helping me understand how Scratch works.
